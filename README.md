### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Oscar Stanchi and I'm a computer engineer. I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Computer Science at the National University of La Plata (UNLP), focusing on the interpretability of deep neural networks in computer vision. I primarily work with PyTorch and Captum.

In addition to my research, I have experience programming in C for embedded systems (microcontrollers) and with parallelism libraries such as Pthreads, OpenMP, and OpenMPI. I'm also proficient in MATLAB and have a passion for digital electronics and satellite telecommunications.

Thanks for stopping by!
